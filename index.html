    <h1>Queues</h1>
    <p>
      A queue is a data structure that follows the
      <b>First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.</b> Meaning that the first
      element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Think of it
      like a queue of people waiting in line, where the person who arrives first
      is the first to be served.
    </p>
    <p>The two main operations associated with a queue are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Enqueue:</b> Adds an element to the (end) of the queue</li>
      <li>
        <b>Dequeue: </b> Removes and returns the element from the front
        (beginning) of the queue.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Additionally, there is often a third operation:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Front (or Peek):</b> Returns the element at the front of the queue
        without removing it.
      </li>
    </ol>
